Wet (with water) underpants are better than wet (with something that’s not water) or dirty underpants. Or more importantly, wet underpants are better than no underpants at all. Especially in winter.\nNow the final important feature here is that these are “one size fits most” which itself seems like it can’t quite be true, but the only real way to know if these will get you out of a tight situation is to grab a couple and run a safe test in the warm confinements of your own home.\nInstant Underpants on Amazon Instant Underpants\nNot too unlike instant noodles\nAnother item that falls under the ever-popular “just add water” category, seems to have no shortage of interesting and extremely useful items.
