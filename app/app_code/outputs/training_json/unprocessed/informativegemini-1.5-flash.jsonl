The description should be unique to the image.\n\n### **Examples:**\n**Good Alt Text:** 'A person in a wheelchair crossing the street on a sunny day.' (Concise, relevant, and informative)\n**Bad Alt Text:** 'An image of a person outside.' (Too vague, lacks key details)\n\nNow, generate **one** alt text description following these rules."
